# Excel Data Visualization Project

This project showcases my ability to analyze and visualize data using **Microsoft Excel**. I used Excel to clean, analyze, and present key insights through charts, pivot tables, and dashboards.

## 📊 Project Overview

Using Excel, I built a well-structured spreadsheet that includes:

- Cleaned and organized datasets
- Interactive charts and graphs
- Pivot tables for summarizing trends
- A dashboard view for at-a-glance analysis

The visualizations provide clear insights into patterns, comparisons, and trends in the data.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Trends and changes identified through dynamic line and bar charts
- High-performing segments or categories visualized with pie/donut charts
- Patterns and outliers spotted using conditional formatting and scatter plots
- Summary statistics displayed in a clean dashboard layout

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel (Office 365 / Excel 2021 or later)**
- Functions: `VLOOKUP`, `IF`, `SUMIFS`, `COUNTIFS`, `INDEX-MATCH`
- Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts
- Excel Dashboard features (Slicers, Timelines, Linked Charts)

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- 📈 **Data Visualization**: Created clear, professional charts (bar, line, pie, column, scatter) for presenting trends and comparisons.
- 🔧 **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized formatting.
- 🔄 **Interactive Dashboards**: Built user-friendly dashboards using slicers, timelines, and linked charts.
